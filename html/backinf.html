                <h2>Introduction to the problem</h2>
                <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
                <p>The problem on which this game is based on is the problem of minimazing logic expressions.
                     This logic expression defines which input leads to an output True. The problem had multiple input variables and one output. This can be given in a table.
                     and the expression is represented by a sum of products. The goal is to rewrite this sum of products to an easier and smaller form that represents the same input combinations.
                    </p>
                <h3>The importance of the problem</h3>
                <p>This problem is very important in computer science and electrical engineerin. Suppose we want to make a logic circuit with multiple input variables and one (or more)
                    output variable. In the sum of product of this circuit every sum can be implemented by an OR-gate and every product by an AND-gate. Therefore, by minimazing
                    the expression, the amount of needed AND- and OR-gates can be greatly reduced.
